My name is [Marcel Eichner](/about/) and I’m a full-stack web developer from Berlin. developing [PHP](https://www.google.de/search?q=php) and [Javascript](https://www.google.de/search?q=javascript) since 2001, I’m a master at devising elegant, bespoke online solutions to complex technological issues. While I thrive on tackling new challenges, I’m equally happy improving existing projects. I’m also competent at defining products and managing project teams.

Say hello to [ME](mailto:marcel.eichner@ephigenia.de)
