A born and bred Berliner, I've been working as a freelance developer since the age of 18, back in 2001. My early passion for media art and communication design pathed the way and soon I discovered the beauty of PHP and JavaScript. 

Whether it’s API development for a blockchain-based social network, leading a web app’s frontend team for Daimler AG, or consulting in science projects, I love to tackle complex challenges and always strive for a clearly structured product. 

Looking back at 20 years of coding for successful – and failed – start-ups and businesses, I’m excelling in supporting project teams with concepts, consulting, and high-quality code covered by reliable unit testing.   

When I’m not working, you’ll find me playing around with open-source technologies or trying to prepare the perfect beef brisket on my BBQ.

Let me know how I can support you.
