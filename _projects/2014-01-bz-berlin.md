JavaScript & PHP Development for the completely new Wordpress-driven website of one of the largest daily newspapers from germany. I was responsible for developing, testing and integrating the new design as responsive, Wordpress-templates and a lot of javascript components. Some of these components a live-ticker module which worked similar to the twitter-timeline, a map which showed the articles located in berlin and a flexible slideshow module. All these modules where 100% tested with Mocha & PhantomJS.
