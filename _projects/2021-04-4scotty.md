    Node.js/JavaScript development for the full microservice & event-driven  reverse job marketplace.
---
In April 2021 I joined the development team at 4scotty to maintain their current legacy meteor application and the newer version of an event-driven microservice-like application.

My daily tasks included improving code-quality, introduce standardised logging mechanism, query the MongoDB, write and improve unit-tests, setup code-quality tools, improve Dockerfiles, [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and bug-fixing. The complexity of the services involded required deep examination.

After stabilizing the legacy applications I started to create a new GraphQL API and a and a variadic, dynamic data-transformation service for data-migration.

In this project I had the change to learn lots of things about some AWS services like Lambda, Kinesis, SQS, API Gateway, CloudFormation, DynamoDB, S3 and deployment using [serverless](https://www.serverless.com).
