excerpt: |
    Concept and development of a restful API proxy written in express and lots of middlewares to access and simplify internal API service.
---
Supported the international team of Creamfinance android and backend developers by creating a RESTful proxy API which enables specific limited and authenticated access for an application.

Next to basic express routing, test-driven development and continuous integration processes I’ve gained experience using docker and the continous integration service bamboo by atlassian.

Additionally I’ve created a microservice which works on a persisted queue of messages which are pushed to firebase cloud messaging.
