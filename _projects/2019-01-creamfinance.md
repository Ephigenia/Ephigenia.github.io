excerpt: |
    Concept and development of a restful API proxy written in express and lots of middlewares to access and simplify internal API service.
---
Supported the international team of Creamfinance android and backend developers by creating a RESTful proxy API that enables specifically limited and authenticated access for an application.

Next to basic express routing, test-driven development, and continuous integration processes I’ve gained experience using docker and the continuous integration service bamboo by Atlassian.

Additionally, I’ve created a microservice that works on a persisted queue of messages which are pushed to firebase cloud messaging.
