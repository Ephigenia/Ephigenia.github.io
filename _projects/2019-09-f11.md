At the end of 2019, I started to support factor-eleven, a marketing and advertising agency from the midwest of Germany to take their conversion to a technology-driven company. With my skills in designing and programming REST-APIs in node.js, Continuous Integration, and Microservices I was happy to help my increasing number of team members.

## Recommendations

> Marcel is a highly skilled and quality-focused software engineer, who's a pleasure to work with. Both socially and technically.

- [Florian Schäffler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fschaeffler/) (Node.js Expert)

> Marcel is very reliable, responsible and communicative person. He can always distinguish what is important and what is not, what can bring the most value for business and what is just a noise. I can only recommend Marcel, and I hope to work with him in the future.
