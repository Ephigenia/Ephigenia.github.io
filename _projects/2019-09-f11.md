At the end of 2019, I started to support factor-eleven, a marketing and advertising agency from the midwest of Germany to take their conversion to a technology-driven company. With my skills in designing and programming REST-APIs in node.js, Continuous Integration, and Microservices I was happy to help my increasing number of team members.
