    Supporting the backend development team with my expertise in node.js and REST-API development.

[APPICS](https://appics.com/) is a reward-based social media application based on the famous social blockchain [steem](https://steem.com/).

Happy to join my second blockchain-related project so far. The project was still in a closed alpha phase but already had a solid and growing user base. I supported the all-remote team by fixing bugs and extending the feature set of the different backend services.
