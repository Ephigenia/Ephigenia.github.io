> [APPICS](https://appics.com/) is a next generation, reward-based social media application that introduces a new ecosystem which merges lifestyle, passion, and user-generated income inside a single mobile application. Unlike on any other popular social media site, where 100% of the platform’s value and revenue goes to the corporate shareholders, APPICS enables all users to earn a fair share of the overall revenue, as well as creative influence within the network, through a cryptocurrency reward-token.
