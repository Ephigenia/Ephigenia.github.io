    Supporting the frontend-development team at DTAD with crucial tips and best practices on how to progressively migrate a legacy JavaScript application to modern vue-driven architecture.
---
In early 2020 I’ve been contacted by DTAD to provide crucial tips & best practices for migrating legacy frontend applications. After some preparational meetings, Workshops, and code-reviews I’ve given the team a good start to migrate the legacy frontend code. The plan was to progressively migrate the whole frontend code by replacing and adding new [vue](https://vuejs.org/) components and more MVP-oriented, [dry-out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) modern frontend architecture.
